Q1 Lifting state up:
     when we have the two or more components but they have the same working data
     in react we know data flow from parent to child we keep the state into the parent component
    then we create the main parent component
Q2. Debugging
    Debugging mean finding and fixing the error in the program
    when we work in the react then 
    state.count = state.count + 1; instead of this we use the useState function
    setCount(Count+1);
    props property-- if we cannot mention props in the parent then we cannot access the props in the Child function.
 Q3..Redux
     Redux is the state management library it is used when we handle globel state in the large application 
     in simple when many component need the same data and app become complex then we use the redux.
 Q4..React hook
        React hook is used  for manage the
        there are many hook
        useState(is used in the state management)
        useEffect(work in the side like API)
        useRef 
Q5..Virtual DOM
       virtual dom is used for react faster. it s the lightweight of the real dom. when user click on the button the react create the state and create the new virtual dom then react compare the virtual dom with the real dom 
       then update the UI.
